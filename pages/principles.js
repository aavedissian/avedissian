          <p>Principles and mental models I’ve found useful.</p>
          <p>Transcend Paradigms. More important than any one mental model is to keep onself unattached, to stay flexible, to realize that no model is “true,” and that every one, including the one that sweetly shapes your own worldview, is a tremendously limited understanding of an immense and amazing universe that is far beyond human comprehension. It is to let go into not-knowing, into what the Buddhists call enlightenment.</p>
          <p>Take Action. In the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass">buridan’s ass</a>, the donkey dies because it’s unable to decide. Don’t be the donkey – take action, even when there’s no clearly preferable option.</p>
          <p>Compound. The greatest returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from <a href="https://anthonyavedissian.substack.com/p/on-compounding">compound interest</a>.</p>
          <p>Prioritize. Decide on the most important priority for this: decade, year, quarter, month, week, day. Systematically allocate time to meet those priorities and relentlessly execute against that.</p>
          <p>Engineer serendipity. Luck is not magic. It’s a state of mind and a property of social networks. It can be measured, analyzed, and <a href="https://medium.com/aspen-ideas/engineering-serendipity-941e601a9b65">engineered</a>.</p>
          <p>Invert. To be successful in life & business, rather than study success (subject to survivorship bias), study the causes of failure and engineer the elimination or mitigation of those risks.</p>
          <p>Cautious optimism. Say “yes” before “no”. It’s way too easy to be default-pessimistic.</p>
          <p>Endless curiosity. Stay as close to the edge as you can without going over. You’ll see new things you can’t see from the center.</p>
          <p>Live holstically. The term “work-life balance” sets up a <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.nateliason.com/p/work-life-balance">false dichotomy</a>, implying work and life must be traded off. Instead, integrate work as one part of a holistic life, where each area supports and complements others (mental + physical health, relationships, fun).</p>
          <p>Radical honesty. Honesty, not only with others but also oneself, leads to deeper relationships, clear decision-making, and a more authentic life.</p>
          <p>Pareto Principle. 80% of results are often driven by 20% of efforts. Consider this law of diminishing returns to maintain high efficiency and output.</p>
          <p>Sunk Cost Fallacy. Make decisions on the basis of future value, not on unrecoverable past events/investments.</p>
          <p>Feynman Technique. You don’t understand something well enough until you can explain it simply (in a few sentences, with simple words).</p>
